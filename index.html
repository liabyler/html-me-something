        <h2>What We Do</h2>
           <p>I am the Vice President of a local non-profit called Saving St. Louis Pets.  We are 100% Volunteer run.  But we are all also 100% dedicated to our mission of saving Pets and Strays in need throughout Missouri and the surrounding states.  For owned pets we offer Pet Parents financial assistance with expenses such as urgent medical treatments, through our grat program.  For stray pets we offer funds to cover urgent medical treatments, sponsorship to assist in placment, transportation, TNR, and funds for spay/neuter among many other things.  We raise funds through our FaceBook group and with events such as silent auctions.</p>
           <h2>Pixie</h2>

           <p> Pixie was a very young cat.  She was only about 5-6 months old and she had a home.  Unfortunateley her family allowed Pixie to roam outside  her home and she had not been spayed.  As a result Pixie became pregnant while she was still too young to carries her kittens (less than 5 months) to term safely. When she could not give birth to her kittens on her own Pixie was rushed to the Emergency vet.  The vet reached oujt to Saving St. Louis Pets and we had the rush Pixie into surgery.  Unfortunately it was too late and Pixie's life could not be saved.  I was devestated by the loss of this prescious baby and vowed to do someting to presever her memory and help other kittens.</p>
           <h2>Pixie's Promise</h2>
           <img src="images/Pixies Promise.jpeg" alt="Pixies Promise" height="390" width="275">
           <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> Out of the loss of sweet Pixie was born the Pixie's Promised Memorial Fund.  The goal of Pixie's Promise is to ensure that no other owned pet will have to suffer as Pixie did. This is achieved by offering funds to the families of Owned pets to cover the cost of spay/neuter.</p>
